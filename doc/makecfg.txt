INTRODUCTION                                                          *makecfg*

Vim'a |:make| command is simple and elegant, but requires the user to configure
their 'makeprg' and 'errorformat' options to the tool they want to use.
MakeCFG aims to be a database of these settings for various compilers,
interpreters and build tools. It contains a JSON file with data about the
different options, and basic API for using it.

MakeCFG hopes to get many tiny pull requests that add the settings of more and
more tools, so if the one you use is not in here yet - please add it to the
JSON and we'll try to approve the PR as soon as possible. The repository is

USAGE                                                           *makecfg-usage*
